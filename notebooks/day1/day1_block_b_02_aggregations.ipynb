    "1. **COUNT(*)** - Counts all rows (including NULLs)\n",
    "2. **COUNT(column)** - Counts non-NULL values\n",

    "4. **Mental model:** \"For each X, calculate Y\"\n",
    "5. **Rule:** SELECT columns must be in GROUP BY or aggregated\n",
    "6. **Result:** One row per group (collapses detail rows)\n",

    "### WHERE vs HAVING\n",
    "7. **WHERE** - Filters rows BEFORE grouping\n",
